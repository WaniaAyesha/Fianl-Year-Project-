# Fianl-Year-Project

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the New Electricity — Andrew Ng. Data science is the new oil. Artificial intelligence (AI) is making its way its way into many fields --- from diagnosing cancer to predicting stock prices. Big corporate companies are relying more and more on data-driven decisions. However, there is a multitude of use cases where AI can be used for individual users for e-commerce. 
 
For my final year project, we would like to purpose a user-friendly smart application development (initially a rudimentary python script) that gives users an estimate of the price of used vehicles in Pakistan given their care make, model, condition and many other variables. In the few lines below I will try to present my motivation for the proposed project.

As more and more business and private customers move towards online platforms, there is a growing need for some platform where people can get at least an initial idea of the price range for used/second-hand vehicle irrespective of whether they are a buyer and seller. Currently, this takes a lot of market research and effort involved for common people which is time-consuming and tedious. Moreover, there is a lack of such applications and services in the given market of Pakistan.

Now that a formal motivation for the project is established, we would like to enumerate an initial breakdown of the project;

•	Initial literature and market research.
•	Installation and hands-on with the development environment and libraries  
•	Scraping training data from the internet and other services (if possible) for the training of machine learning training.
•	Formal problem definition.
•	Selection of appropriate machine learning (ML) algorithm. 
•	Training of machine learning (ML) algorithm.
•	Selecting evaluation matrices for performance.
•	Validation and testing of the proposed algorithm.
